	<h1>Constructing lifelines, not pipelines: Pemón uses of Internet and Communication Technologies in Extraction Zones</h1>

</header>


<main>

    <h2 id="abstract"><u>Abstract</u></h2>    
    <p>My research project traces how Pemón peoples living in and around Canaima National Park in Venezuela use Internet and Communication Technologies (ICTs), and what can we learn about technology, natural resource extraction, and Pemón resistance from these uses of technology. Far from staying victim to a dominant application of technology that facilitates extraction for profit, Pemón people living in extraction zones have leveraged ICTs, such as blogs (<a href="http://movimientopemon.blogspot.com/">Movimiento Pemón</a> and <a href="http://caciques-generales.blogspot.com/">Consejo de Caciques Generales</a>), social media (Instagram and YouTube) and the infrastructure that supports them, to extend networks of resistance across Pemón and other Venezuelan Indigenous groups, to re-fashion tribal practices to attract younger generations of Pemón to reconnect with their ancestral lands, as well as to promote continuance of traditions. It also examines the construction of Pemón peoples, and of Indigenous peoples in Venezuela more broadly, as technological have-nots by the state. Methodologically, I engage with methods from Community-Based Scholarship, Critical Indigenous Studies, Latin American Studies and Digital Methods.</p>

<h2 id="motivation"><u>Motivation</u></h2>


    <p>Machine Vision Components (MVC) are becoming safety-critical. Assuring their quality, including safety and reliability, is essential for their successful deployment. Such MVCs are shown to be prone to mistakes when facing scene changes, e.g., rain or snow, in the real-world deployment environment. For example, the MVC deployed in the UBER SUV failed to recognize a pedestrian with dimmed light in the scene (i.e., at night) and caused an accident in 2018 <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/05/29/why-ubers-self-driving-car-killed-a-pedestrian">[1]</a>.</p>




    
    <h2 id="what"><u>What is MVC Reliability?</u></h2>

     <p>MVC performance against scene changes is commonly studied as <i>model robustness</i> in Computer Vision (CV). Yet, scene changes such as dimmed light are neither invalid nor adversarial inputs as considered by robustness analysis, but rather <i>expected environment conditions</i> in which the system is deployed.
    <br>
    Therefore, studying whether the MVC performance remains unaffected by scene changes that occur in the real-world deployment environment is a <b>reliability</b> problem rather than a robustness problem.  
    
    In software engineering, <i>reliability</i> is defined as: ''the ability of a system or component to perform its required functions <i>under stated conditions</i> in a specified period of time''<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/610.12/855/">[2]</a>. Note that the <i>expected environment conditions</i> we consider in reliability corresponds to <i>stated conditions</i> in the SE definition. 
    <br>
    In this project, we are specifically interested in whether the performance of an MVC remains reliably unaffected by image transformations that commonly occur in real-world scenarios, through <u><i>requirements specification</i></u>, <u><i>testing and verification</i></u> and <u><i>safety assurance</i></u>.</p>


<h2 id="re"><u>Requirements Specification</u></h2>
<p>MVCs are becoming safety-critical. Assuring their quality, including safety, is essential for their successful deployment. Assurance relies on the availability of precisely specified and, ideally, machine-verifiable requirements. MVCs with state-of-the-art performance rely on machine learning (ML) and training data, but largely lack such requirements. 

In this project, we address the need for defining machine-verifiable reliability requirements for MVCs against transformations that simulate the full range of realistic and safety-critical changes in the environment.  
Using human performance as a baseline, we define reliability requirements as: "if the changes in an image do not affect a human's decision, neither should they affect the MVC's." </p>
