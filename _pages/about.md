I am a PhD student in the Department of Hispanic Languages and Literatures at the University of Pittsburgh. I am interested in representations of natural ruins in contemporary Venezuelan cultural production. I do this from Andean perspectives and from intersections between feminist and queer theory, as well as new materialisms.
