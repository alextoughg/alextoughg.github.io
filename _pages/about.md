Â¡Hola! I am a PhD student in the Department of Hispanic Languages and Literatures at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.hispanic.pitt.edu). I am interested in deterioration in contemporary Venezuelan narrative and poetry. Earlier, I received an MA in Hispanic Linguistics as well as a BS in Computer Science and Spanish at the University of Toronto. 

You can find my most recent CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf) and my Google Scholar here. Feel free to reach out to me at <alt159@pitt.edu>.  

This page is still a work in construction, thank you for your patience!
