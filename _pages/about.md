I am a PhD student in the Department of Hispanic Languages and Literatures at the University of Pittsburgh. I am interested in representations of natural ruins in contemporary Venezuelan cultural production. I do this from Andean perspectives, from thinkers such as Gamaliel Churata and CÃ©sar Calvo, and from intersections between contemporary feminist and queer theory, in particular, starting from what Rosi Braidotti calls the "critical posthumanities".
