Â¡Hola! I am a PhD student in the Department of Hispanic Languages and Literatures at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.hispanic.pitt.edu). I am interested in representations of violence in contemporary Venezuelan narrative and poetry. Earlier, I received an MA in Hispanic Linguistics as well as a BS in Computer Science and Spanish from the University of Toronto. 

You can find my most recent CV [here](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf) and my Google Scholar [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=EBlxkvcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F5sf6bSsExlqFDexf3Wy8UXoBxkmKjJVmtMP4957U75fi9ZlfdCnf_vUF0PUnbUkFCWbSyIw_edNhUVMCYWMRpMQM6K-88dp5zuG9PIA0ubgRL81_4).
